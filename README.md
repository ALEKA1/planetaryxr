## Overview
[PlanetaryAR](http://codemacabre.com/prj/planetaryar/) is an augmented reality (AR) web app featuring 3D models of planetary bodies, built using [A-Frame](https://a-frame.io/), [ARToolKit](https://artoolkit.org/) and the [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) library.

Although primarily focused on creating an AR experience, PlanetaryAR also features a virtual reality (VR) variant which will build upon the 3D planetary models by offering a locational data and a lightweight map interface.

To test the AR and VR apps, visit the [links](#links) sections below.
