# MarsAR

## Overview
[MarsAR](http://codemacabre.com/prj/marsar/) is an AR / WebVR 3D map of Mars using [A-Frame](https://a-frame.io/) and [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js), currently in very early development.

## Usage
MarsAR can be run as a local webpage. For development it is faster to run a local server:
+ Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
+ From the command-line, `cd` to the `marsar` directory
+ Run `npm start`. If your default browser doesn't open automatically, open `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice.

## Resources
The Mars planetary map texture is from NASA's [3D Resources](https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/mar0kuu2) page. Future iteraions will use a higher definition basemap.

## License
MarsAR is open source, licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/CodeMacabre/marsar/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
