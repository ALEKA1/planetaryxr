## Overview
[PlanetaryAR](http://codemacabre.com/prj/planetaryar/) is an augmented reality (AR) web app featuring 3D models of planetary bodies, built using [A-Frame](https://a-frame.io/), [ARToolKit](https://artoolkit.org/) and the [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js) library.

Although primarily focused on creating an AR experience, PlanetaryAR also features a virtual reality (VR) variant which will build upon the 3D planetary models by offering a locational data and a lightweight map interface.

To test the AR and VR apps, visit the [links](#links) sections below.

## Resources
Planetary basemaps have been taken from the following locations:
+ Mercury: [USGS](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Mercury/Messenger/Global/Mercury_MESSENGER_MDIS_Basemap_BDR_Mosaic_Global_166m) (using data from NASA's [MESSENGER](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/main/index.html) mission)
+ Venus: [USGS](https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/details/Venus/Magellan/Colorized/Venus_Magellan_C3-MDIR_Colorized_Global_Mosaic_4641m) (using data from NASA's [Magellan](http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/magellan) mission)
