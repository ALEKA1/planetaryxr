# MarsAR

## Overview
[MarsAR](http://codemacabre.com/prj/marsar) is an AR / WebVR visualisation of Mars based on [A-Frame](https://a-frame.io/) and [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js), currently in very early development.

## Usage
MarsAR can be run as a local webpage, but for development it is faster to run a local server:
+ Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
+ From the command-line, `cd` to the `marsar` directory
+ Run `npm start`. If your default browser doesn't open automatically, open `localhost:3000` in your browser of choice.
+ Press `ctrl-c` or `cmd-c` to close the local server.

## Resources
The Mars planetary map texture is from NASA's [3D Resources](https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/mar0kuu2) page.
